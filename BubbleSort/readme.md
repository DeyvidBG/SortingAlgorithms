# Bubble sort

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

# Bubble sort - Complexity

## Time Complexity

**Worst Case Complexity:** O(n2)
If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then the worst case occurs.
**Best Case Complexity:** O(n)
If the array is already sorted, then there is no need for sorting.
**Average Case Complexity:** O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).

## Space Complexity

1. Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable is used for swapping.
2. In the optimized bubble sort algorithm, two extra variables are used. Hence, the space complexity will be O(2).

# Bubble Sort Applications

Bubble sort is used if

1. complexity does not matter
2. short and simple code is preferred
